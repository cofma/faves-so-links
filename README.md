# Bangkok Farang Notes

Personal collection of honest, no-BS observations and discussions from a farang living in Bangkok.  

Mostly covering real experiences at venues, transport headaches, crowd avoidance, value vs. hype, and the usual expat gripes/scams. Nothing polished, just straight talk.

### Why this exists
I got tired of glossy TripAdvisor reviews and tourist trap lists that don't mention the 10pm taxi nightmare or the hidden gems locals actually use. So I started writing up my own takes + opening threads for others to add their stories.

### Featured discussion right now
Millennium Hilton Bangkok – farang review  
Rooftop bar views are killer, but the Thonburi side traffic/boat shutdowns after 10pm are a pain. Lounge access worth it? Breakfast still meh? Check the full thread with replies:
